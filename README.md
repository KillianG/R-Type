# How to code
First create your branch, or use existing one except master and preprod, because they are protected.<br>

When your code works in your branch and passes all unit tests you created (min: 75% coverage), you can create a merge request to preprod branch. As assignee put @Kyashar or @KillianG. Then we will look at your code and if everything is ok, set merge request as ok and merge.
